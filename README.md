# Pytorch image classification

This is a framework for producing image classification models.

# Attribution

The codebase is inspired from the course **Deep Learning with PyTorch** by [OpenCV.org](https://opencv.org/courses/). Take a look at the [LICENCE](./LICENCE) if you are using/forking this repository.

# Installation

First, install `torch` and `torchvision` (refer to [pytorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)):
```bash
# if you have python 3.6 and for cuda 11.0
pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

Then, install the other packages :
